Jerwin Pagela,"In a Filipino's perspective, this kind of music is a little new to us as well. In their name SB19, SB means Sound Break which shows their advocacy of breaking the stereotypes of what the usual Filipino music is and also to show that Filipinos could also have a talent as to what Kpop Idols have. As to what they're also saying, they are still promoting PPop ( Filipino Pop Music) as they are using Filipino as a language for the lyrics. If you want to hear more of the power of their vocals you can try to listen and review to their debut song  ""Tilaluha"".",659,556,33,SS,0,Not-Request,,,1,Positive

Chel Sea,"They are gaining more attention because of their refreshing style which is very different from the normal style here in the Philippine music scene. They are, unfortunately, being criticized of being TOO Korean sounding by some Filipinos. Although, I beg to differ. So many Filipino groups have attempted to imitate Korea's music style to no avail because it was either awkward or borderline plagiarism. SB19, however, is the first group to attract this many people because of how they were able to combine both the Kpop influence and Filipino identity (with regards to their lyrics and visuals) well.It's great to see that the genres we have here in the Philippines is expanding.",243,679,33,SS,0,Not-Request,,,,

They debuted last year but only now that they got recognized by many filipinos. They're actually making history. They are the first legit filipino boy group that any filipinos can be proud of (no offense to other filipino groups but they need to step it up). I can feel their passion and their dedication. SB19's hardwork has paid off. Goodluck guys. Godbless.",149,537,33,SS,0,Not-Request,,,1,Request

Watch EXO MONSTER,Well SB19 is currently popular here in the Philippines and as for me as a Filipino I am proud that there is finally a filipino group of musicians that will be able to inspire more filipinos to pursue their dreams specifically in music. And as for the song it was actually addicting and pleasant to the ears and its the type of song that will be able to hook you into their world and their charms are overflowing as well. But just like what you have said i also felt quite saddened because i know that they are capable of doing more but the song weren't able to show their talents for the song doesn's have the part where you'll be surprised and etc. Well this is only my own insight so others opinion may differ :))) anyways thank you for reacting to them -fanboy from Philippines,137,780,33,SS,0,Not-Request,,,,

Yeahyeah YeahAte,"Hi Taetae, the members themselves composed the lyrics and created the choreo for this song Go Up! From a Pinoy's point of view,   they are really good in all areas, their vocals are very stable even during their live performances, they can also do acapellas(their choir-like blending voices/vocals are really good), their crisp movements and dance routines are very polished and synchronized(you might want to check out their dance practice videos here on youtube as well). For me, Go Up is a very catchy and lively song hence I like it so much(can't even remember how many times I've watched it). If you want to hear how good they really sound in terms of their powerful vocals, please do watch their TILALUHA video and/or their acapella version of the song on 'SB19 Thank You Message for TILALUHA' video, both can be found here on youtube.Your constructive video review for this MV is very much appreciated. I believe that our boys deserve all the attention and hype that their getting right now. Looking forward to more reviews for SB19. We Filipinos and their fans are soooooooooooooo soooooooo proud of them.Btw, another short trivia, the name of their fanbase is called Aurum --and Aurum is a latin word for gold hence the chem element symbol Au.

Raxle Eros,"Hi Sir TaeTae. Thank you for your honest reaction to my idols' MV. We, Aurums, appreciate your honest critiques and compliments.About your question on our perspective on SB19, Filipinos became attracted to this idol group recently is because of their synchronized dance practice video and fresh vibes they're bringing to OPM (Original Pinot Music). They are now introducing a fresher version of Philippines Pop (P-POP) in my homeland which have a touch of Korean Pop vibes. Maybe, it is because they're company is a Korean Entertainment, and the producer of their song ""Go Up"" is also the producer who worked with some popular Korean Idols, such as Wanna One and Stray Kids. In short, they're bringing a new trends to Philippines music industry, and we're loving it.Fun Facts:Their first single is called ""Tilaluha"", which is a ballad song about heart break. They're exploring different genres. There are only 2 singles with official MVs (""Go Up"", and ""Tilaluha""), and another 2 singles without official MVs or official studio recorded yet (""Love Goes"", and Hanggang sa Huli), but they're performing all of those 4 songs in their events here in the Philippines. They're exploring different styles every time and they're really working hard in making their own lyrics and choreography, that's why we Filipinos love them. Suggestion and Request:Please continue to support them and  their songs in the future. Personally, I love your honesty and the way you gives critiques to them in a professional manner. Hope to see you in the future, with their new song. Thank you.PS. New subscriber here ",5,1591,1,Positive,1,Request,,,,
esembee_ hall,"6:22 ""Filipino"" this is the correct spelling TaetaeWell, I've first heard ""TilaLuha"" before ""Go Up"" was release. Being a Filipino, I used to listen on emotional songs or songs that is very heartwarming as in ""tagos sa puso"". SB19 voices are very unique and the fact that they are writing their own lyrics made me respect them. And Go Up already entered the taste of Filipino when it comes to music. They are the best boy group existing here in Ph.10:59 Taetae's comment I loved the most and I can agree 10000000000000000000000%11:41 I also love your comment on this part.Taetae, as a Filipino and in my own perspective, SB19 is more impactful than other singers here in Ph. They are the freshest singers who can dance and sing, a total performers. I think you should check translations of their songs also. Like BTS, I like songs with deep meanings or poetic. SB19 used Filipino  lyrics but not in street style. Mostly of the rising singers here in Ph uses slang and street style lyrics, it's not my taste due to the fact that it bends our language. It is still the best, hearing a great composed, proper Filipino lyrics, it's worth hearing.TAETAE, Thank you for always doing reactions on Filipino singers.

They arent the usual portrayed handsome in the philippines, since the philippines visual standards on men tend to lean on strong features while appearing very masculine like: black hair, swept up, biceps and abs kinda visuals. since they are under a korean entertainment and, their fashion and styles lean towards the korean idol stereotype, which they do look good at and pull off. but for my personal opinion, they are reeeeally handsome and charming, and on top of that their skills and talent make them even more handsome haha.",2,1010,33,SS,0,Not-Request,,,,

They already break some over stereotype's about some certain tracks that other artists cannot do. The way they dance was on point, every lockings and some moves that give some more spice on their performance are within their hearts, and passion. They trained hard for this to come true. They're singing skills are awesome, no one can change my mind about that. SB19, is very popular in here and slowly abroad not only because of their singing and dancing skills, but also because of they're hardwork,being a family oriented, God fearing and very lovely attitude towards their fans. They treat A'TIN (SB19's fandom name) as a genuine family by hearts that I ain't see enough from the other regular artists in here too.  About the MV, it makes me smile widely and makes my heart flutter. Mwo? cause it shows that they are indeed eager for their dreams. Meanwhile, about the extravagant vocals  please do watch and listen on their covers, most importantly their debut song TILALUHA where you can hear the powerful tune of them.

Even though they are trained by a Korean company and are inspired by K-pop, they aim to share Filipino music to fellow Filipinos and the whole world.As you mentioned, you made your review from the point of view of a Korean, and even though you already appreciate the over all familiar feel of the song, you still found something lacking. From my own point of view (as a Filipino), I can say that this song already delivers a complete package for the Filipino taste, even with Pinoy fans of BTS and other popular K-pop groups. From what I know, they are the first idol group here, even though there are already existing boy bands, among which they stand out.Please do keep an eye out on this group.

rielitty,"Hi Taetae! Many Filipinos love Kpop, and ShowBT ( The Korean Entertainment Company ) and SB19 went on to create music that breaks the stereotype of Filipino music and dance with Korean influence/inspiration. They're doing amazing and the attention they're getting makes many happy, as some find it refreshing and very innovative to create music of such a new genre in the Philippines. SB19 has a goal to diversify and show that Filipinos too have talents and can perform, be listened to and watched worldwide, together with the usage of the Tagalog language ( PH language ). Despite all these, there are also people who have negative views on SB19, as they seem to think that they're a bit too Kpop and looking like they're just wannabes. While it is true that they are trained/made/inspired by a Korean Company, they do well to represent Filipinos and our language and I stand by that completely. It just is that people will find ways to criticize on new and upcoming things, and I'm sure SB19 is taking into account all the feedback they are getting that they may improve more!They're the first Male Idol group in the Philippines, and we're glad to have you react to them.

Simply Prismal,"As a Filipino, I have so much love and support  for this group, and respect for their challenge to change the music scene in the Philippines. A lot of OPM (original Pinoy music/equivalent to Koreas 가요) has mainly pulled from American pop and big soul influences like Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc. Theyve held very true to this older style and there arent a lot of people that have tried new things. This style of music is just as new to Filipinos as it is to everyone else, especially with using primarily Tagalog lyrics instead of switching between English and Tagalog in most of the song. Many Filipinos are still calling them a KPop band even though they are PPopAs far as visuals, many Pinoys have fallen in love with more exotic visuals which translates to a lot of half Filipino stars. A lot of the teen stars have gotten their start from pinoy big brother, where a lot of them were half Australian, half american. I dont believe that SB19 would automatically rank the highest in terms of looks among the current Pinoy stars.  They have very traditional Filipino features and I think most of them have moreno skin ( 검은 피부). Which I love even more because it shows that ShowBT wanted to produce genuine talent instead of just looks. theyre also not as young as kpop idols, their maknae is 21. Ive never been so captivated by a pinoy group that genuinely sings amazing and live on stage, or dances choreo that doesnt.  resemble your typical line dancing. Im ecstatic that they are getting recognized and have been making more tv appearances. Wow 너무 길어, 미안합니다 ㅋㅋ",0,1570,33,SS,0,Not-Request,,,,

ashton go,"whaaa I really like this guy he always makes reviews for Filipino singers. I think the first time he made a review for morisette he convinced me to listen to her haha. SB19 has gained so much instant popularity in the Philippines. Filipinos really like Kpop but it feels different for most people when it is Filipinos themselves doing it. Some unfortunately feel like SB19 are victims of colonial mentality and trying too hard to be Korean. Of course this is not how I feel. I am a big fan of SB19 and a strong believer of what theyre pioneering in the Philippines. But most old fashion conservative Filipinos try to stick to less pop and more OPM (Original Pilipino Music) musicians like Morisette, Darren, etc. I think it will take some time for SB19 to become very popular but theyve already gained an impossible amount of attention Im really excited for them.",0,863,33,SS,0,Not-Request,,,,

Clar Clar,안녕하세요~ 사실은 이런 음악 스타일이 필리핀에서 처음이에요여기는 솔로 아티스트이나 밴드이나 많아요...이런 아이돌 그룹이 별러 없어요 ... 필리핀 국민들이 야간 러브송이나 발라드송 많이 들어요~그리고 제가 봤을땐 이 팀이 비쥬얼은 못생긴 편 아닙니다 그냥 평균이에요 ..그런 느낌~ 사실은 요즘에 많은 필리핀 사람들은 외모 때문이 아니라 이 그룹 재능이 때문에 관심 많이 받듭니다 ~ 우리 나라에서 이런 그룹이라면 이 아이돌 그룹의 질은 상당히 뛰어납니다~ 동기화는 다른 그룹과 비교했을 때 훨씬 더 좋습니다~ 필리핀의 관점을 대변하는 발언입니다~항상 솔직한 리뷰를 해 주셔서 감사합니다.잘 되길 바래요~,2,340,1,Positive,0,Not-Request,,,,

So this guys really deserves a spot on Music Industry in PH and I hope they continue to receive positive feedback and support. Thank you for reacting to their MV ",0,765,33,SS,0,Not-Request,,,,

SB19 is a new boy band group that set a new par to P-pop industry. In our perspective, it is fresh and new to our ears though we hear it like k-pop but when they use Tagalog lyrics it feels so new and we like it. P-pop is now starting to evolve. I also get your point that you are sad because you are expecting to have some power (I dont know what kind of powers or angst you are trying to say) but for us it set its par! We love the music, we love the message and we like the style. Very fresh to our eyes and ears. Vocal wise they are superb! Great blending! I hear high and low notes combined! Isnt great right?

In terms of the groups popularity, they are now pretty much recognized here in Philippines because of a new style of Pop music. Yes, it's somewhat similar to Kpop but their goal is to break into thr PH's music scene with a fresh kind of  song and as a Filipino, we are proud that we have an idol group like SB19. If you have time  and want to review/react more on their vocal skills, you may search the live performances of their songs ""TILALUHA"" in NET25 LETTERS & MUSIC and ""HANGGANG SA HULI"" uploaded by RIDER PH STUDIOS.

I was amazed at their dancing skills and the synchrony was awesome!! Their KPoP style training was evident but it was ultimately  their talent, hard work and dedication that made them stand out.

Pink Panther,"Hi, thanks for making this review, i love to hear about Korean's opinion about SB19 specially coming from a vocal trainer like you, mainly because you are speaking about Kpop standards. It just means that, they just need to improve on some areas of their song making and vocal abilities. Which I believe and trust that they will be able to do it in the coming days. I've always wondered about the kind of training kpop idols have, and now i'm seeing the result. These boys are indeed talented. And they give this fresh vibes through this song.. To be honest, I never thought that a boy group would come this close to Kpop standards, I was one of those critic of the boy groups that debuted here in the Philippines. Yes, we have talented singers. We also have talented dancers. But to rock both worlds and in a group is kind of another level. And they are the first boy group here in the Philippines who passed that standard, in my own opinion. They don't sound and look like trying hard, and they're not cringey. I've never been this proud to call it our own. I can almost see the big picture that one of these coming days, P-Pop idol groups are the next big thing here in the Philippines. and SB19 will be one of the BIG pioneers. ^_^",0,1235,1,Positive,0,Not-Request,,,,

It has a twist of kpop that's why Filipinos are easily loving them as well because of the former boy group bands in Korea that most of us Filipinos love. They are all being trained by Korean trainers that's why they're having this kind of discipline when it comes to bringing themselves up as they continually becoming popular here. Thank you for wishing them the best in the near future. I am their fan.

Uniquole,"In my perspective as a Filipino, this is something new and something all of us did not expect to work out well. Filipino artists have tried many times before, having a kind of group that can dance and sing well but it all failed. Those filipino artists that have tried this had made it sound corny, the lyrics and the dances all sounded forced to me. I thought we Filipinos should just stop and focus on 100% vocals as that is the only thing I see that our country is very good at and well-known. But when the 1st time I heard SB19, it has excited me because I didn't know it would work! The lyrics were on point, and the music too. It's catchy and it didn't sound forced to me. It all sounded natural and finally, a Filipino group who can not only sing well, but be in sync when dancing. It excites me what more they can offer. It made me want to listen to them more. I thought ""ahh, so this is how it sounds like when a korean listens to kpop""",0,945,33,SS,0,Not-Request,,,,
Zhin,"12:21 In a Filipino stand point, the music style is definitely not new to us, as majority of SB19's supporters are kpop fans too. Honestly, rather than bringing new sound to the Philippine music industry, they're more like ""setting the standards and raising up the boygroup game"" in the industry. Any kpop fans definitely has adapted the ""korean standards"" for choosing their idols. The fact that Filipino Kpop fans anticipated and cheered for them for SB19's 1st comeback, it is already a sign that they're definitely worth to be supported. They may not be the most handsome or 'visual' looking idols, but I do believe that they're being recognize more because they're talented, genuine and humble persons more than having ""the kpop concept"".

When I learned about the group, SB19, I was hesitant to watch their videos as the genre may be a bit off-tangent again comparing to what we usually hear in most of the Filipino music. But it is so surprising that the group pulled out the music so well. It was such a good mix of the Tagalpg lyrics with that of the K-pop vibe. It is new but it is not boring.

As a kpop fan i can say that I am really meticulous when it comes to boy groups because I,we know how k-trainings were done. After seeing their talents I can proudly say that these guys are really talented and not trying hard,they have more to show and thanks to their company for bringing out their talents in this competetive way.Where in the world where people judge only the surface of what they see and only love the things who are shining brightly.Yes it has Kpop influenced, and i must say Kpop here in Philippines and Kdramas are a bit.

Some other people think they are weird but i think this group has awesome and has an unique style of music. Combining 2 countries and cultures are very hard to accept to others but they did it well to shown to others what is music all about.

They wrote the lyrics of their songs but recorded in Korea and produced by a Korean producer(WannaOne producer) that's why there's a Kpop vibe on this song.

The only difference is that they wrote songs in Filipino which  makes them unique. I think to appreciate the song even more, you have to know what the song is all about. After all, music is a form of expression. We feel the music because somehow we can relate to it. Read the translated lyrics. There's a lot of videos with hangeul translation.

I'd even dare say that if there was such a thing as ""international singing baseline/threshold"", I'd say we'd be near the top. With that being said, most of us can distinguish which singers are decent, and which ones are really good.I think the main reason why Filipinos follow K-Pop is due to the visuals and concepts that are currently lacking in our music industry.

onlylouie,"The Philippines is the home of world class performers and powerful belters. And I can proudly say that we are a musically inclined country. Its in our genes . So it is our nature to appreciate talent rather than the looks. However, during the advent of kpop, some filipinos went crazy about looks/visuals. That was the time, I think, when the ""other"" portion of filipinos look down and criticizes kpop, in general. I think thats the reason why there are still some people bashing SB19. But, overall,  I think these boys have great talents. They have the potential to be known and become global. As what they are trying to convey, they want to break the barriers which, I think is already happening. They are a game changer in the Philipine Music industry.

And I think its because of the way we produce an ""artist"".Unlike Korea, where before one could debut as an artist one would undergo rigorous training, here in the Philippines mostly the primary ""must have"" to be an artist is the looks. Once you have the visuals then your good to go. I really appriciate this group, the SB19, cause they are paving/opening a new market in the music industry here in the Philippines. It's really hard cause they don't know yet if the mass would accept them with their music style and there's the expectation to them being on the level of kpop which is a whole different thing. I'm just really hoping that the Phil. media would stop branding them as Pinoy ""K pop"" boy group cause it is P POP only and not KPOP. they are only managed by a korean company where they go through the same training as those Idol groups in Korea.

Cherish Rufino,"This is a wonderful reaction.About the vocal system in the Philippines...It's all about practicing and honing our vocals since we were very young, I guess. Filipinos also love to sing power ballads which is a very challenging genre to perform. In our country, the more difficult the song you're able to sing, the better you are as a singer. Singing plays a huge part of our daily lives. We sing whenever and wherever we feel like it. So don't be surprised if you'll meet someone singing by himself/herself while walking on the street or while riding on a public transportation vehicle. It's normal here .There are tons of singing competitions in the Philippines. We love fiestas and there are thousands of them being celebrated around the country. Everytime that there's a fiesta, there is definitely going to be a singing competition.Filipinos are emotional people and we best express ourselves through music and singing. Thus our love for karaokes . If you'll have the chance to visit our country, you'll understand. These are the reasons why a huge chunk of our population can sing well.",0,1090,1,Positive,0,Not-Request,,,,

Jhunna Rebusora,"There's no such thing as training system in the Philippines like what Korea has with your Kpop idols being trained for years to be a good singer. But Karaoke machines are everywhere here where Filipino who are naturally born singers can enhance their vocal ability. And Morissete is not the best Filipino singer, but one of the best. I can't even pick the best one since there are a lot of established Filipino singers before her and in her generation. But she has a distinct singing ability which set her unique among the other Filipinos. Hitting high notes is like slicing a cake for majority of our singers.
